# Buddy Style Web Demo

This project is a small static website inspired by Buddy.ai. It includes a hero section, feature highlights, a basic integration with the cTrader Open API, and a simple contact form.

## Files

- `index.html` – main page with features, how it works, a trading history table, and contact sections.
- `styles.css` – styling for layout, the trading history table, and interactive elements.
- `script.js` – handles form submission, smooth scrolling, and cTrader API calls.

Open `index.html` in your browser to view the site.
